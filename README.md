# `@bitty/get`

A really small and type-safe (requires TypeScript >= 4.1.3) function, that gets a nested value from an object using a path string (like `"a.b[0].d"`). If value is `undefined` or unreachable returns the placeholder instead.

-   üì¶ Distributions in ESM, CommonJS, UMD and UMD _minified_ formats.
    -   Supports both NodeJS used with ESM (`import`/`export`) and CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`).

-   ‚ö° Lightweight:
    -   Weighs less than 150 bytes (when minified and gzipped).
    -   Tree-shakeable.
    -   Side-effects free.

-   üîã Batteries included:
    -   No dependencies.
    -   Its not based on newer browser's APIs or es2015+ features.

-   üè∑ Safe:
    -   JSDocs and type declarations for IDEs and editor's autocomplete/intellisense.
    -   Made with TypeScript as strict as possible.
    -   Unit tests with AVA (types was also tested).

It's approach is based on [idx](https://github.com/facebookincubator/idx), from Facebook, and an _insight_ from a Vue.js meetup where [@IgorHalfeld](https://github.com/IgorHalfeld) showed a way to get nested values using `eval`.
